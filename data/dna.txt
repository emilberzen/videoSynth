\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 The idea and the general considerations about the possibility of recording, storage and retrieval of information on DNA molecules were originally made by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Samoilovich_Neiman"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Mikhail Neiman}}\'a0and published in 1964\'9665 in the\'a0

Among early examples of DNA data storage, in 2007 a device was created at the University of Arizona{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-5"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22\fsmilli11200 \cf4 \super \strokec4 [5]}}, using addressing molecules to encode mismatch sites within a DNA strand. These mismatches were then able to be read out by performing a restriction digest, thereby recovering the data. This system has a number of advantages over other methods. Firstly, unlike other methods in which bespoke molecules are synthesised for each new DNA encoding, a common set of molecules could be used to encode any arbitrary data. DNA synthesis is currently expensive, and laborious, so this means that this investment can be used to encode many different sets of data, using the same set of DNA molecules. The encoded DNA created here is also "bio-compatible", meaning that, in principle it can be readily inserted into, and propagated within, an organism.\
On August 16, 2012, the journal\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal)"}}{\fldrslt

Multiple copies for redundancy were added and 5.5\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabit"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 petabits}}\'a0can be stored in each cubic millimeter of DNA.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-church-6"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22\fsmilli11200 \cf4 \super \strokec4 [6]}}\'a0The researchers used a simple code where bits were mapped one-to-one with bases, which had the shortcoming that it led to long runs of the same base, the sequencing of which is error-prone. This\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 research result}}\'a0showed that besides its other functions, DNA can also be another type of storage medium such as hard drives and magnetic tapes.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-nanews-2"}}{\fldrslt

An improved system was reported in the journal\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)"}}{\fldrslt 
\i \cf4 \strokec4 Nature}}\'a0in January 2013, in an article led by researchers from the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Bioinformatics_Institute"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 European Bioinformatics Institute}}\'a0(EBI) and submitted at around the same time as the paper of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Church"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Church}}\'a0and colleagues. Over five million bits of data, appearing as a speck of dust to researchers, and consisting of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 text files}}\'a0and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_file"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 audio files}}, were successfully stored and then perfectly retrieved and reproduced. Encoded information consisted of all 154 of Shakespeare's sonnets, a twenty-six-second audio clip of the "I Have a Dream" speech by Martin Luther King, the well known paper on the structure of DNA by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watson"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 James Watson}}\'a0and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Francis Crick}}, a photograph of EBI headquarters in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinxton"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Hinxton}}, United Kingdom, and a file describing the methods behind converting the data. All the DNA files reproduced the information between 99.99% and 100% accuracy.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-goldman-3"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22\fsmilli11200 \cf4 \super \strokec4 [3]}}\'a0The main innovations in this research were the use of an error-correcting encoding scheme to ensure the extremely low data-loss rate, as well as the idea of encoding the data in a series of overlapping short\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligonucleotide"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 oligonucleotides}}\'a0identifiable through a sequence-based indexing scheme.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-nanews-2"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22\fsmilli11200 \cf4 \super \strokec4 [2]}}\'a0Also, the sequences of the individual strands of DNA overlapped in such a way that each region of data was repeated four times to avoid errors. Two of these four strands were constructed backwards, also with the goal of eliminating errors.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-goldman-3"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22\fsmilli11200 \cf4 \super \strokec4 [3]}}\'a0The costs per megabyte were estimated at $12,400 to encode data and $220 for retrieval. However, it was noted that the exponential decrease in DNA synthesis and sequencing costs, if it continues into the future, should make the technology cost-effective for long-term data storage within about ten years.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-nanews-2"}}{\fldrslt

The long-term stability of data encoded in DNA was reported in February 2015, in an article by researches from\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 ETH Zurich}}. By adding redundancy via\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Reed\'96Solomon error correction}}\'a0coding and by encapsulating the DNA within silica glass spheres via\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol-gel"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 Sol-gel}}\'a0chemistry, the researchers predict error-free information recovery after up to 1 million years at -18\'a0\'b0C and 2000 years if stored at 10\'a0\'b0C.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-grass-7"}}{\fldrslt

\fs22\fsmilli11200 \cf4 \super \strokec4 [8]}}\'a0By adding the possibility of being able to handle errors, the research team could reduce the cost of DNA synthesis down to ~$500/MB by choosing a more error-prone DNA synthesis method. In a news article in the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Scientist"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 New Scientist}}\'a0the team stated that if they are able to further decrease the cost they would store an archive version of Wikipedia in DNA.\
Also, a group of researchers, led by Boise State University is working toward a better way to store digital information using nucleic acid memory (NAM). They suggest that the global flash memory market is predicted to reach $30.2 billion this year, potentially growing to $80.3 billion by 2025. They estimated that by 2040, the demand for global memory will exceed the projected supply of silicon (the raw material used to store flash memory), and that nucleic acid memory has a retention time far exceeding electronic memory. They have discussed the longevity of the DNA materials through first principle theoretical calculations that is published as commentary research article.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-Zhirnov-9"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22\fsmilli11200 \cf4 \super \strokec4 [9]}}\'a0According to their claims "With information retention times that range from thousands to millions of years, volumetric density 10

\fs22\fsmilli11200 \super 8
\fs28 \nosupersub \'a0times less, we believe that DNA used as a memory-storage material in nucleic acid memory (NAM) products promises a viable and compelling alternative to electronic memory." and "Given exponentially increasing demands for safeguarded information worldwide, and the long retention times for DNA (ranging from thousands to millions of years), NAM can store the world's information for future generations using far less space and energy. NAM could thus be used as a time capsule for massive, infrequently accessed records in scientific, financial, governmental, historical, genealogical, personal and genetic domains.".{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-Zhirnov-9"}}{\fldrslt

The above methods of DNA storage had the disadvantage that the whole strand of synthetic DNA has to be sequenced in order to retrieve only one of several data sets that were previously encoded. In April 2016 researchers at the University of Washington published an encoding, storage, retrieval and decoding method that enables random access of any one of the data sets\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-10"}}{\fldrslt
